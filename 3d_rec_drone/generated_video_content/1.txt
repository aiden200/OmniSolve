The video continues with an overhead shot of the train derailment aftermath. The scene is obscured by a haze of dust and smoke, making it difficult to see details clearly. 

The camera then quickly pans across the scene, briefly revealing more of the wreckage and debris field, including overturned train cars, scattered debris, and emergency vehicles. The rapid movement of the camera creates a blurring effect.

The viewpoint shifts again, providing a wider view of the scene from a slightly different angle. This new perspective shows the extent of the damage and the smoke plume rising from the site.  The smoke appears to be dissipating slightly, revealing more of the wreckage.

Next, the camera moves again, this time rapidly panning and tilting across the scene. The quick movements and haze create a disorienting visual effect, further emphasizing the chaotic nature of the aftermath. 

The final shot stabilizes, providing another overhead view of a section of the wreckage. The dust and smoke have partially settled, offering a clearer view of the derailed train cars, emergency vehicles, and the scarred landscape.
