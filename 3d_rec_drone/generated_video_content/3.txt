The video shows an overhead view of the train derailment aftermath.  The angle is almost directly above the wreckage. The foreground shows several derailed and damaged train cars, some black tanker cars and at least one white passenger car. The ground is scarred and darkened, likely from the explosion and fire. A thin layer of dust and smoke still hangs in the air, partially obscuring the scene.  The train cars are lying at various angles, some overturned, others piled against each other.Â   A few bare trees and a dirt road are visible adjacent to the derailment site. In the background, beyond the road, more ground, some small structures (possibly outbuildings or equipment sheds), and what appears to be a larger white tent or temporary structure are visible. The overall scene depicts the destruction and disarray caused by the derailment and explosion.
