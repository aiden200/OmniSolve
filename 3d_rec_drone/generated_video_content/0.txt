The video appears to depict a simulated train derailment and explosion. 

It begins with a close-up overhead view of a derailed train. Some of the train cars are white, and others are black. The train lies next to a dirt road, and some scattered debris is visible. Buildings are present in the scene.


Suddenly, a large explosion erupts, engulfing the train and surrounding area in dust and debris. The viewpoint then shifts, providing a wider aerial perspective of the scene as smoke and dust billow from the site of the explosion. The damaged train cars and debris are clearly visible amidst the dust cloud.


The viewpoint changes again to another aerial perspective, showing the train wreck from a similar position as the start of the video, however the smoke is still rising.
